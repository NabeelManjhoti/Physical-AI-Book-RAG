# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** - an authoritative resource that bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and embodied systems. This textbook explores the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of AI systems that interact with the physical world through robotic platforms.

## About This Textbook

This textbook is designed for students, researchers, and engineers who want to understand the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics. It covers the essential technologies and concepts needed to build intelligent, embodied systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world.

## Course Structure

The content is organized into a quarter overview followed by four comprehensive modules and a capstone project:

- **Quarter Overview**: Introduction to Physical AI concepts and course structure
- **Module 1**: ROS 2 - Robot Operating System fundamentals (nodes, topics, services, rclpy, URDF)
- **Module 2**: Gazebo & Unity - Physics simulation and sensor integration
- **Module 3**: NVIDIA Isaac - GPU-accelerated perception and control with Isaac Sim, ROS, and Nav2
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models - Using Whisper and LLMs for robotic planning
- **Capstone Project**: Integration of all concepts in a practical humanoid robotics application

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this textbook, you will be able to:
- Design and implement robotic systems using ROS 2
- Create physics-based simulations with Gazebo and Unity
- Leverage NVIDIA Isaac for advanced perception and control
- Apply VLA models for intelligent robotic planning
- Integrate all components in a complete humanoid robotics system

Start your journey by exploring the [Quarter Overview](./overview/intro) or dive directly into [Module 1: ROS 2](./module1/intro).
