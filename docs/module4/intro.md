# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent the cutting edge of embodied AI, enabling robots to understand natural language commands, perceive their environment visually, and execute appropriate actions. This module explores how VLA models integrate perception, reasoning, and action in robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:

- Understand the architecture of Vision-Language-Action models
- Implement Whisper for speech-to-text processing in robotics
- Integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) for robotic planning
- Connect VLA models with robotic control systems
- Design multimodal perception-action systems
- Evaluate and deploy VLA models for robotic applications

## Module Structure

This module covers:

1. **VLA Fundamentals**: Understanding multimodal AI for robotics
2. **Whisper Integration**: Speech processing for robotic commands
3. **LLMs for Planning**: Language models for action planning
4. **Integration**: Connecting VLA models with robotic systems

VLA models represent the convergence of computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics, enabling more intuitive human-robot interaction.
