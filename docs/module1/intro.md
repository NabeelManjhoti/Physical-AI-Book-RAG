# Module 1: ROS 2 Introduction

This module introduces the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the middleware framework that enables communication and coordination between different components of a robotic system. ROS 2 provides the infrastructure for building distributed robotic applications with support for multiple programming languages, real-time systems, and distributed computing.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:

- Understand the architecture and concepts of ROS 2
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes for robotic applications
- Implement communication patterns using topics, services, and actions
- Work with rclpy for Python-based ROS 2 development
- Define robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several key components:

1. **Nodes, Topics, Services** - Core communication mechanisms
2. **rclpy** - Python client library for ROS 2
3. **URDF** - Robot description and modeling

Each section includes theoretical concepts, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.
