# Module 2: Gazebo & Unity - Physics Simulation and Sensor Integration

This module covers two major simulation environments used in robotics: Gazebo and Unity. Both provide physics simulation capabilities and sensor integration, allowing robotic systems to be tested in virtual environments before deployment on real hardware.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:

- Understand the principles of physics simulation in robotics
- Create and configure simulation environments in Gazebo
- Integrate Unity for advanced simulation scenarios
- Implement sensor models and perception systems
- Connect simulation environments to ROS 2 systems
- Design realistic physics models for robotic applications

## Module Structure

This module is organized into:

1. **Physics Simulation Fundamentals** - Understanding physics engines and their application to robotics
2. **Gazebo Simulation** - Working with the Gazebo simulation environment
3. **Unity Integration** - Using Unity for robotics simulation
4. **Sensor Modeling** - Creating and integrating sensor models

Simulation environments are crucial for robotics development as they allow for safe, repeatable testing of algorithms before deployment on expensive hardware.
