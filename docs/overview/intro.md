# Quarter Overview

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This quarter provides a comprehensive exploration of how artificial intelligence can be embodied in robotic systems to create intelligent agents that interact with the physical world.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this quarter, students will understand:

- The fundamental principles of embodied intelligence
- How to design and implement robotic systems using modern tools
- The integration of perception, planning, and action in robotic systems
- Practical applications of humanoid robotics

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, students should have:

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with Python and basic Linux command line
- Understanding of fundamental mathematics (linear algebra, calculus)
- Basic knowledge of physics concepts

## Course Structure

The course is organized into four progressive modules:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2** - Robot Operating System fundamentals
2. **Module 2: Gazebo & Unity** - Physics simulation and sensor integration
3. **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac** - GPU-accelerated perception and control
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models** - AI-driven robotic planning

Each module builds upon the previous, culminating in a comprehensive capstone project that integrates all concepts.

## Learning Path

We recommend following the modules sequentially to build a solid foundation. Each module includes:

- Theoretical foundations
- Practical implementation exercises
- Simulation environments for testing
- Integration challenges

## Assessment

Students will be evaluated through:

- Module-specific projects
- Integration assignments
- Final capstone project
- Peer collaboration on complex robotics challenges
